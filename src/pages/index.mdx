<legend>About</legend>

Kitsune is a microblogging server that utilises the ActivityPub protocol to connect your instance to a global interconnected network.  
Not only can you speak to other Kitsune users through it, you can also connect to people using software like Mastodon, Misskey, etc.

⚠ Kitsune is still very much a work-in-progress ⚠

(Note that a lot of these are still WIP)

-   Simple GraphQL-based API
-   Markdown-formatted posts
-   Mastodon API compatibility
-   Typo-tolerant full-text search

Mastodon API compatibility means that you can use your favourite Mastodon clients like, "Tusky" or "tooot", with Kitsune!
