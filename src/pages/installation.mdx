This guide will only go over the Docker-based installation for now.

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the two Dockerfiles in the repository. Make sure you use the `Dockerfile.prod` versions, the other version produced slower debug builds.

    1. Navigate into the `kitsune` subdirectory and run `docker build -t kitsune -f Dockerfile.prod .` to build the main server
    2. Navigate into the `kitsune-search` subdirectory and run `docker build -t kitsune-search -f Dockerfile.prod .` to build the search server

3. Configure the environment variables inside the `docker-compose.yml` to your liking (make 100% sure that you changed the `DOMAIN` value to your domain!)
4. All you have to do now is to run `docker compose up` to boot up the Kitsune instance

The instance will listen on port 5000 by default.

## Setting up TLS

You want to run Kitsune behind a reverse proxy that handles the TLS termination.

> We, in fact, don't support running the server without TLS support at all. All the ActivityPub resources contain URLs using the `https://` scheme.

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/v2) is a good choice for this, since it's easily configured and automatically handles certificate renewals.

Follow Caddy's official guides on how to install the server.  
Depending on what installation method you chose, the Caddyfile has to be put into a different place.

A basic Caddyfile that should get your server up and running should look something like this:

```
[your domain here] {
	reverse_proxy localhost:5000
}
```

Then start Caddy using the Caddyfile you just created as the configuration and done!  
Kitsune is now running on your server with an automatically renewing TLS certificate.

> **Note**: There is a lot more to securing your server than just adding TLS support, but this is out of the scope of this guide.
